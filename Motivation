Empathetic chatbot:

I read upon an article about 'Carl: An empathetic chatbot' by Stanford that is built upon DialoGPT, pretained with reddit conversations, and that is how the idea of an empathetic chatbot fascinated me.

Being a very empathetic person myself, I felt it was very close to my nature to build something that resonates with my ideologies and that is why instead of using an available dataset, I thought of creating my own that sat well with my personal thinking, as to how I would want someone to console me.

Just adding it here, that this project is by no chance complete, and I plan on making the dataset larger as and when I come across an inspiration in my day to day life :)
